Project description: This webmap displays different Indian reservations throughout the United States, we can identify the native sites closest to natural gas plants. The United States census bureau offers hapefiles for each of the native reservation across the US, using such data we can identify where each location is and refrence the dot density map depicting gas plants across the U.S.

Project goal :
This webmap is designed to reach environmental activists and native residents who are concerned for the well being of sacred land. A map with symbols at each reservation location with symbols for gas plants will make native territory and its proximity to gas plants identifiable.
